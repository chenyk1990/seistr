**seistr**
======

## Description

**seistr** is an open-source Matlab package for 2D/3D local slope estimation and structural filtering. The seistr package has a variety of applications in both exploration and earthquake seismology, including but not limited to seismic denoising, seismic reconstruction, seismic diffraction separation, constrained LSRTM, constrained FWI, etc. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first (and only) open-source Matlab package for calculating the seismic slope of an input seismic gather/cube/image and performing structure-oriented filtering.

The python version of the seistr package can be found at https://github.com/aaspip/pyseistr.

## Gallery
The gallery figures of the seistr package can be found at
    https://github.com/chenyk1990/gallery/tree/main/seistr
Each figure in the gallery directory corresponds to a DEMO script in the "demo" directory with the exactly the same file name.

The first example is a 2D synthetic test generated by test_seistr_syn2d.m in the demos directory.
